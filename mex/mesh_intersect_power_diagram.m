%% [output_vertices, output_triangulation, power_cell_indices, mesh_indices] = mesh_intersect_power_diagram(mesh_vertices, mesh_triangulation, circle_centers, circle_radii, bbox_bottom_left, bbox_top_right)
% /// This function takes a triangular mesh, a collection of circles, and a bounding box and computes the intersections of the triangles in the mesh with 
% /// the cells in the power diagram. It returns triangles formed via triangulating the resulting intersections as well as which mesh triangle and which power
% /// cell each of the output triangles belongs to.

% /// Inputs:
% ///     mesh_vertices: two-column matrix containing the vertices of the triangular mesh
% ///     mesh_triangulation: three-column matrix representing the mesh triangulation
% ///     circle_centers: two-column matrix containing the centers of the circles
% ///     circle_sqradii: vector containing the squared radii of the circles
% ///     bbox_bottom_left: two-element vector representing the coordinate of the bottom-left corner of the bounding box; the bounding box must contain the entire triangular mesh

% /// Outputs:
% ///     output_vertices: two-column matrix containing the vertices in the output triangular mesh
% ///     output_triangulation: three-column matrix representing the output triangulation
